## Key Findings
- **Random Forest** consistently delivers the best trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and computational cost.  
- **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy on Adult Income but at prohibitive training cost.  
- **Linear models** (Logistic / Linear Regression) remain competitive when interpretability and efficiency are priorities.
